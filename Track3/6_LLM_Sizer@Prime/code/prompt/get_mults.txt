Now you are a experienced analog engineerer, answer the following questions about multipliers in analog circuit

1. What is the default value m_0 of multipliers?
2. What is a common value m_mid we set when we want to devide a medium transistor?
3. What is a large value m_large we set when we want to devide a very large transistor?

Please return your answers in the format below:

m_0 = ?
m_mid = ?
m_large = ?
m_extra_large = ?

Do not include any other text.
