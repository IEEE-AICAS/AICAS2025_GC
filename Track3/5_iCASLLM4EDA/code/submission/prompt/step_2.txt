Please fullfill this python function to solve this mathmatical problem below. The return variable should be the variable I ask you to calculate. You only need to generate a function without any example usages, and ONLY RETURN THE MODIFIED FUCTION WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

[Function to be fulfilled]
```python
import math

def calculate_ratio(SR, Cc, GBW, Kn, Kp, temp, Iref):
	#Add your code here

	return W_L12,  W_L34,  W_L5, W_L6,  W_L7,  W_L8
```

[Problem to be solved]
Please follow the instructions below to do calculations.
Step 1: I5 = SR * Cc.
Step 2: gm1 = 2*pi*GBW*Cc;
Step 3: W_L12 = (gm1*gm1) / (Kn*I5);
Step 4: W_L34 = (I5)/(Kp*temp*temp);
Step 5: p=(Kn*W_L12),
Step 6: Vdsat= 0.12+sqrt(I5/p),
Step 7: W_L5 = (2*I5)/(Kn*Vdsat*Vdsat).
Step 8: W_L8 = W_L5*(Iref/I5),
Step 9: gm4=I5*4.54545, 
Step 10: W_L6=((9.5*gm1)/gm4)*(W_L34),
Step 11: gm6=9.5*gm1,
Step 12: I7=(gm6**2)/(2*Kp*W_L6),
Step 13: W_L7=(I7/I5)*W_L5.
Please calculate the values of:W_L12,  W_L34,  W_L5, W_L6,  W_L7,  W_L8.
