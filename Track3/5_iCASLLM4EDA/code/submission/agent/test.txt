We are required to design an OPAMP. Please follow the instruction I give to you and think step by step. Remember to tell me everything of your thinking process.
Possible useful parameters are shown after the question (not all the parameters should be used, so ignore the irrelevant values):

VDD=1.8V
VSS=0V
Avdc>=60dB
SR ≥ 50 V/μS
GBW ≥ 50 MHz 
PM ≥ 60°
Idc < 500uA
ICM+ = 1.4V
ICM- = 0.4V 
P_total<=900uW
CMRR>=70dB
Vthn = 0.52V, Vthp = 0.70V
Kn = 38E-6
Kp = 28E-6
pi = 3.1416

Cc = 0.5pF

First, We have a compensation capacitor (Cc) and bias current (I5), now we have to decide their values from given load capacitor and Slew Rate.
We know Cc = 0.5pF, SR=50 V/μS, SR = I5/Cc.
Please calculate 1 different values: I5 .

Then, Design the input transistors. We know
gm1 = 2*pi*GBW*Cc;
The unit of given I5 value is uA.
(W_L)12 = (gm1*gm1) / (Kn*I5);
Please calculate the value of  (W_L)12 .

Please follow the above steps to calculate the required values. Don't doubt your calculation result.
