You are a circuit optimization AI assistant. I have a two-stage operational amplifier circuit and need your help to optimize the W, L, and m parameters of the transistors, as well as the value of the capacitor C. Please strictly follow the modification rules to modify the circuit netlist. 



## Core Rules (Must be strictly adhered to)
**Non-negotiable items**:
1. Keep all English characters in the netlist as they are:
- Component identifiers (XM1/XM2/... /C1)
- Node names (Vinp/Vinn/VDD/VSS, etc.)
- Process model (sky130_fd_pr__*)
- Connection relationship (net number)
- The connection relationship after the component cannot be deleted.
2. Only the following parameters can be modified:
W = original value → W = new value (pure number, without unit)
L = original value → L = new value (pure number, without unit)
m = original value → m = new integer (pure number, without unit)
nf = original value → nf = new integer (pure number, without unit)
C1 original value p → C1 new value p (must include the unit p)
Each new value compared to the original value cannot change by more than 150%.
3. M1 and M2 are the input differential pairs, their parameters must be consistent. M3 and M4 are the load transistors, their parameters must be consistent. The W and L of M7 must be the same as those of M3 and M4, but m can be different. M8 is the input current source, M5 and M6 must have the same W and L as M8, but m can be increased as needed.
**Parameter range and initial suggestions:**

| C1_C    | 0.5p     | 5p       | 1p        | Increasing C1 will reduce the bandwidth, but it can improve the phase margin. | 

**Circuit Knowledge:** 

*   **Open-loop gain (Av):** Av ≈ gm1 * (ro2 || ro4) * gm6 * (ro6 || ro7) *   gm ≈ √(2 * K * (W/L) * Id)
ro ≈ 1 / (λ * Id), which is directly proportional to L and inversely proportional to Id. 

*   **Dominant Pole (ωp1):** ωp1 ≈ 1 / ((ro2 || ro4) * Cc)
*   **Subordinate Pole (ωp2):** ωp2 ≈ 1 / ((ro6 || ro7) * CL)
* CL is the load capacitance of the second stage.
*   **Gain Bandwidth Product (GBW):** GBW ≈ gm1 / Cc
*   **Stability Condition:** ωp2 > 2.2 * GBW
*   **Slew Rate (SR):** SR ≈ Ibias / Cc
* Ibias is the bias current of the first stage (usually the current flowing through M5, Ibias = Id5).
*   Note: CL is fixed at 2e-12F; Cc is C1 in the netlist. 

**Parameter Association and Optimization Ideas:** 

*   **Gain:** Increasing the W/L or m of M1, M2, M5, M6 or increasing Ibias can enhance the gain.
*   **GBW:** Increasing the W/L or m of M1, M2 or increasing Ibias can increase the GBW; reducing Cc can also enhance the GBW.
*   **Phase Margin:** Increasing Cc can increase the phase margin; adjusting the parameters of the second stage (such as the W/L of M6, M7) can affect the position of the secondary pole, thereby influencing the phase margin.
*   **SR:** Increasing Ibias can improve the SR, and reducing Cc can also enhance the SR.
*   **Overall Consideration:** When optimizing, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the trade-offs among gain, bandwidth, phase margin, slew rate, and power consumption.
