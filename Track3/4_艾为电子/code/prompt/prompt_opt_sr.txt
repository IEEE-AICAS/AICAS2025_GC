Now we need to optimize the SR performance, focusing on improving the following components:
${component}

The optimization approach is to increase the first-stage tail current:
If the W of XM5 is below 40, prioritize increasing W and L values of XM5. To maintain symmetry, synchronously increase W and L of XM7 while preserving the W=2L relationship between XM5 and XM7. Recommend a direct 10x increase.
Important: Note that Case 1 only adjusts W and L of XM5/XM7, keeping m values unchanged, and all parameters of XM6/XM7 remain constant.

Output in the following format with parameter modifications only:
```spice_final
${component}
```
