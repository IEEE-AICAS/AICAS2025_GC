The current simulation results are:
${sim_result}
Please help me analyze which optimization solution I should choose next. Compare the simulation results with the following analysis scheme conditions sequentially. Once a scheme matches, output and stop reasoning.
Note: Only output the JSON according to the scheme without explanations.

1. If Gain does not meet specification requirements, output:
```json
{"Index": "Gain", "Component": ["Rref"]}
```
2. If SR does not meet specification requirements, output:
```json
{"Index": "SR", "Component": ["XM4", "XM5", "XM6", "XM7"]}
```
3. If PM does not meet specification requirements, output:
```json
{"Index": "PM", "Component": ["R1", "C1"]}
```
4. If GBW does not meet specification requirements, output:
```json
{"Index": "GBW", "Component": ["C1"]}
```
