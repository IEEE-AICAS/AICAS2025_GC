Now we need to optimize the gain effect, with a focus on optimizing the following components:
${component}

${gain}

- Optimization approach for excessive gain:
    Reduce the resistance value of Rref by 2k each time.

- Optimization approach for insufficient gain:
    Increase the resistance value of Rref by 2k each time.

Please output in the following format, only modifying parameter values (do not include modification explanations):
```spice_final
${component}
```
