Now we need to optimize the GBW effect, with a focus on optimizing the following components:
${component}

${gbw}

- If GBW is too small:
    Reduce the resistance value of C1 by 0.05p each time.

- If GBW is too large:
    Increase the resistance value of C1 by 0.05p each time.

Please output in the following format, only modifying parameter values (do not include modification explanations):
```spice_final
${component}
```
